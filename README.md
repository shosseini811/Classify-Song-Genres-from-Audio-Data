# Project: Classify Song Genres from Audio Data

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), we will train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). We will first make use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots.
